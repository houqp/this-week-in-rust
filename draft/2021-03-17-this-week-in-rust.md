## Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A generally positive albeit quiet week though many of the perf improvements were gaining performance back from previous regressions. We'll need to continue to keep an eye on rollups as there were two that caused small performance changes.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [edeee..86187](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=edeee915b1c52f97411e57ef6b1a8bd46548a37a&end=861872bc453bde79b83ff99d443d035225f10e87&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

1 Regression, 4 Improvements, 1 Mixed

2 of them in rollups

# Quote of the Week

> it's funny, every time I run into a baffling borrow error, it's preventing me from committing a real, serious mistake
>
> but it can take some thinking to figure out what exactly that mistake is..
>
> sometimes the borrow checker feels like a wise sage on a mountain giving advice in riddles lol
